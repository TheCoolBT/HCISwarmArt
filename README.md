Particle Swarm Simulation

This project is a dynamic particle swarm simulation where particles exhibit behaviors similar to a school of fish.

Color
Description: Choose the color for the species. Each species has its own color, displayed on the particles and the control panel.
Speed 🏃
Description: Sets the maximum speed of the particles for the selected species. Higher values allow particles to move faster across the canvas.
Count
Description: Specifies the number of particles for the species. Adjust to increase or decrease the swarm size.
Average Size 📏
Description: Determines the base size of particles in the species. Larger values result in bigger particles, which attract smaller ones when in close proximity.
Size Variation 🔄
Description: Adds variation to particle sizes. A higher value introduces greater diversity in particle size within the species.
School Strength 🐟
Description: Controls the cohesion of the particle group. Higher values make particles stay closer together, mimicking schooling or flocking behavior.
Path Curvature 🌊
Description: Adjusts how directly particles approach their destination. Lower values result in straighter paths, while higher values create spiral or curved movements.
Whirlpool ♻️
Description: Determines the rotation effect around the species’ destination. Higher values cause particles to orbit around their destination rather than move directly toward it.
User Interaction

Mouse Swipe: Move the mouse across the screen to create a “current” that temporarily increases the speed of nearby particles. Particles influenced by the mouse will decelerate back to their original speed.
Known Limitations

The maximum particle count is capped at 2000 to prevent performance issues. Attempting to exceed this limit will display an error message.
The simulation may experience slowdowns if running too many high-speed particles.
